Over the years, researchers have explored two primary directions to rejoin the oracle bones \cite{GGBW201101003}. The first direction is manual rejoining by human experts \cite{ZJSX201205032}. The experts rely on deep domain knowledge in palaeography, material texture, and historical grammar to identify matching fragments. By closely examining the shapes of fracture lines and linguistic context, the researchers can piece together broken bones and recover lost inscriptions with very high accuracy. This traditional approach, while providing highly reliable results, is time-consuming and limited by human capacity. The second direction is Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods \cite{zhang2021deep, zhang2022data,zhang2025deep}. These methods utilise machine learning based methods to match the edge between bones to rejoin potential bone image pairs. Due to advances in machine learning algorithms and computing power, AI-based methods are able to process thousands of molecular fragments efficiently \cite{zhang2025deep}.
