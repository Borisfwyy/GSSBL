Previous AI-based methods often overlook essential semantic and glyphic features in oracle bone analysis \cite{MSDJ202102014}. These approaches typically rely on local edge patterns to identify fragments from the same bone, emphasising edge similarity. However, due to bone texture, scorching, and erosion marks, many fragments share similar edges. Thus, relying only on edges may lead to false positive predictions \cite{DZXU202304009}. Introducing semantic and glyphic information can provide additional modalities, which can further enhance the reliability of the results \cite{SXYK202505001}. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset that directly provides such semantic and glyphic information. Therefore, a benchmark dataset named Oracle Bone Inscription Dataset with Additional Contextual Reconstruction (OBID-ACR) is proposed. This dataset is constructed from annotated oracle bone fragments, specifically containing multiple inscriptions originating from the same bone to better capture contextual relationships. OBID-ACR provides new resources for training and evaluation, which can be used to train models for tasks such as contextual understanding, divinatory inscription matching, and fragment association analysis.
