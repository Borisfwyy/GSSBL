The fragmentation of oracle bones leads to a major challenge in OBI research \cite{GGBW201101003}. The fragmentation not only disrupts the continuity of individual inscriptions but also obscures the overall structure of sentences, making it difficult for researchers to reconstruct the original text. Such limitations hinder accurate interpretation of the inscriptions, thereby restricting our understanding of ancient Chinese civilisation. Consequently, to rejoin fragmented oracle bones into their original form to complete the sentences has become a key task in OBI studies. By rejoining Oracle bones, complete divinatory inscriptions can be reconstructed, thus providing providing coherent texts. Such reconstruction not only yields more effective historical materials from the Shang dynasty but also offers new support for the classification and provenance analysis of scattered oracle bone fragments.
