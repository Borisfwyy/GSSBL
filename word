Previous AI methods often overlook essential semantic and glyphic features in oracle bone analysis \cite{MSDJ202102014}. These approaches typically rely on local edge patterns to identify fragments that are from the same bone, emphasising edge similarity. However, due to bone texture, scorching, and erosion marks, many fragments share similar edges. Thus, relying only on edges may cause false positives \cite{DZXU202304009}. Introducing semantic and glyphic information can provide additional modalities, which to some extent makes the results more reliable \cite{SXYK202505001}. However, to the best of our knowledge, data containing such information remains unavailable in a direct form. Therefore, a benchmark dataset named Oracle Bone Inscription Dataset with Additional Contextual Reconstruction (OBID-ACR) is proposed. This dataset is constructed from annotated oracle bone fragments, specifically compiling multiple inscriptions originating from the same bone to better capture contextual relationships.
