The fragmentation of oracle bones leads to a series of challenges in OBI research \cite{GGBW201101003}. This phenomenon not only disrupts the continuity of individual inscriptions but also obscures the overall structure of sentences, making it difficult for researchers to reconstruct the original text. Such limitations hinder accurate interpretation of the inscriptions, thereby restricting our understanding of ancient Chinese civilization. Consequently, to rejoin fragmented oracle bones into their original form so as to complete the sentences has become a key task in OBI studies.
